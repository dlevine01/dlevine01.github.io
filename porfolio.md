## Porfolio 

### Localize insights

I researched neighborhoods and summarized this things that make __places unique__ and the way places are like to to change.
  * wrote insights
  * used maps and data analysis
  * yada yada
Insights are the basis of an [app] (http://www.localize.city)   

  
### Transit planning workshops

I organized workshops to train community leaders in transit planning and launched successful ballot measure campaigns to secure $$$ for transit.

### Transit supply chain report

I authored a [report] (https://t4america.org/maps-tools/transit-supply-chain/) showing how investments in public transportation capital projects supports a network of manufacturers and suppliers across the country. The report was vital in securing support for continued transit funding from key Republican members of Congress.
