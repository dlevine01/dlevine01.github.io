        <p>I researched neighborhoods and pulled out factors that make each place unique. Short explanations, maps, and visuals help residents and home hunters quickly grasp the important aspects about a place and how it is likely to change in the future.</p>

        <p>After working with data scientists to map out the most dangerous intersections in New York for people walking and biking, I identified infrastructure fixes for these dangerous intersections and got into local media with a call for the city to improve these unsafe intersections.</p>

        <p>I led planning workshops that guided city and community leaders mapping out big expansions of bus and rail service in regions with limited public transit. The workshops led directly to successful ballot measure campaigns in Raleigh, N.C., Indianapolis, Ind., and Cincinnati, Ohio, where voters approved millions in new dedicated funding for transit.</p>

        <p>For a critical campaign to protect federal funding for public transportation when the Trump administration proposed axeing this funding. With data on the locations of manufacturers in the transit supply chain, I highlighted top districts and states and explained what was at stake for manufacturing communities nationwide through a short report. This helped anchor support from key Republican representatives from manufacturing-heavy districts as new champions for transit funding. </p>
